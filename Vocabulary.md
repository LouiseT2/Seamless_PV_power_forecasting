- GSI (global solair irradiation)
- GHI (global horizontal irradiance) This methodology is a combination of spatial modelling and ANNs techniques. This is the total quantity of shortwave radiation received from above by a surface horizontal to the ground.
- ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) is used to blend two type of forecasting methods.
- DNI (Direct Normal Irradiance)
- NWP (Numerical Weather Prediction): Most used GHi forcasting methods for 4h to the next day. The GHI prediction is based on basic physiquals equations that describe the laws governing the weather.
- NWC (nowcasting) is used for the first couple of hours (high temporal and spatial resolution). However there is a rapid error grow, therefore, NWP is used after the firsts hours.
- IFS (Integrated Forecasting System) is the global NWP model of ECMWF
- ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts)
- DHI (diffuse horizontal irradiance)
- WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting)
- Méso-NH (non-hydrostatic mesoscale)
- CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service)
- ASI (all-sky image)
- BSRN (Baseline Surface Radiation Network)
- CZA (cosine of the solar zenith angle)
- SZA (solar zenith angle)
- Arpège (Action de Recherche Petite Echelle Grande Echelle)
- SIRTA(Site Instrumental de Recherche par Télédétection Atmosphérique)
- OLS (Ordinary Least Squares regression) linear regression
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) : large deviations between predicted 
and measured values are weighted stronger than small 
deviations.
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- MBE(mean bias error)
- R: Pearson coefficient

RMSE and MAE are metrics used to evaluate a Regression Model (OLS). By reducing the errors we are reducing there values.

- GMDH (Group Method of Data Handling)
- GS-GMDH (Generalized Structure Group Method of
Data Handling ) is used to develop an accurate model for
simulating the rectangular sharp-crested side weir discharge coefficient.
- SIS (surface incoming shortwave)
- ANAKLIM++ (Adjustment of
Assimilation Software for the Reanalysis of Climate Data)
- TSO (transmission system operators)
- Neuro-fuzzy system
- COSMO (Consortium for small-scale Modeling)
- ICON (Icosahedral(=20 faces) non-hydrostatic model)
- CMV (Cloud Motion Vector)
- Heliosat method: common principles to numerous algorithms estimating
surface solar radiation from satellite images. Kc is the clear-sky index (between 0 and 1) Kc=CHI/GHIcs
- PDF (probability density function): used for continuious variables (!=PMF used for discret)
- KDE (Kernel Density Estimation)
- MI (Mutual Information): This is a measure of how much the fact of knowing a variable reduces the uncertainty of another variable. It can identify non-linear relationships between random variables.
- LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator)
- ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
- ARD (Automatic Relevance Determination)
- MLP (Multiplayer Perceptron): favorit form of ANN
- ELM (Etreme Learning Machine)
