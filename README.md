Seamless prediction of GHI using machine learning

The aim of this research project is to propose a new power generation forecasting approach. This involves integrating predictions from various time frames using machine learning techniques applied to Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) time series data. By combining different predictions models, the study aims to achieve an accurate prediction of solar irradiance over a continuous time horizon.
